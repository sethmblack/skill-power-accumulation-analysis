# Power Accumulation Analysis

Analyze how unelected power accumulates within institutions through authorities, covenants, expertise monopolies, and structural dependencies. Based on Robert Moses's 44-year accumulation of power without ever holding elected office.

---

## When to Use

- Trying to understand who really controls an organization or system
- Analyzing how someone gained disproportionate influence
- Identifying power structures that outlast leadership changes
- Examining institutions that seem immune to reform
- Understanding why certain people can't be removed

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "How did they get so powerful?"
- "Who really controls this?"
- "Why can't anyone stop them?"
- "How did this become untouchable?"
- "Where does the real power lie?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| entity | Yes | Person, office, or institution to analyze |
| context | Yes | Organization, government, or system they operate within |
| tenure | No | How long they've held power |
| outcomes | No | What they've achieved or blocked |

## Core Principle

> "Those who can build get power. Those who have power get money. Those who have money can build more."
> — Robert Moses methodology

**The Insight:** Power accumulates through structural position, not just personal qualities. Understanding the mechanisms reveals why some actors become untouchable while others remain constrained.

---

## The Five Mechanisms of Power Accumulation

### 1. Revenue Independence

**Question:** Does this actor control their own funding?

Elected officials depend on appropriations. Bureaucrats depend on budgets. But some positions generate independent revenue:
- Fees and tolls
- Bond proceeds
- Enterprise funds
- Endowments

**Signal of power:** When someone can fund their own projects without asking permission, their power multiplies.

### 2. Constitutional or Legal Shields

**Question:** What protections make this position hard to eliminate?

- Contract clauses (bond covenants cannot be impaired)
- Tenure protections
- Constitutional provisions
- Vested rights
- Regulatory capture

**Signal of power:** When removing someone would require changing laws, constitutions, or breaking contracts, they're structurally protected.

### 3. Expertise Monopoly

**Question:** Does anyone else understand how this works?

When one person or office controls:
- Technical knowledge
- Institutional memory
- Key relationships
- Legal interpretations
- Process expertise

...they become indispensable. Replacing them means losing the ability to function.

**Signal of power:** When no one else can do what they do, they cannot be removed without collapse.

### 4. Constituency Dependencies

**Question:** Who depends on this actor's continued power?

Power creates dependencies:
- Jobs controlled
- Contracts awarded
- Favors owed
- Projects benefiting key groups
- Information access

**Signal of power:** When removing someone would harm many powerful people, those people will protect them.

### 5. Structural Longevity

**Question:** Does this position outlast normal political cycles?

Elected officials serve terms. Appointees serve at pleasure. But some structures persist:
- Authorities with perpetual charters
- Tenured positions
- Self-perpetuating boards
- Offices tied to ongoing functions

**Signal of power:** When the position persists across administrations, power accumulates over time while oversight resets with each election.

## Workflow
### Step 1: Map the Position

- What is the formal title/role?
- What is the actual scope of influence?
- How long have they held it?
- Who appointed/elected them?

### Step 2: Trace the Money

- Where does funding come from?
- Is it appropriated or self-generated?
- Who controls spending decisions?
- Are there surpluses? Where do they go?

### Step 3: Identify Protections

- What would it take to remove this person?
- What legal/structural barriers exist?
- Who would have to act?
- What would they risk by acting?

### Step 4: Map Dependencies

- Who benefits from this person's power?
- Who would lose if they fell?
- What coalitions protect them?
- What would break if they left?

### Step 5: Assess Vulnerability

- What could actually end this power?
- External rule changes?
- Patron withdrawal?
- Scandal exposure?
- Overreach/failure?

## Red Flags: Power Accumulation in Progress

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| "No one else understands this" | Expertise monopoly forming |
| Self-funding mechanisms created | Revenue independence |
| "Can't be changed while bonds outstanding" | Legal shield in place |
| Survives multiple leadership changes | Structural longevity |
| Controls many jobs/contracts | Constituency dependency |
| Attacks critics personally | Defensive posture of entrenched power |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**User:** "Our university's facilities director has been in the role for 25 years. Every president comes and goes, but he remains. He controls a $50M annual budget, and no construction project happens without his approval. Why is he so powerful?"

**Power Accumulation Analysis response:**

Let's map the mechanisms:

**1. Revenue Independence:** Partial
- The $50M budget is likely appropriated, not self-generated
- BUT: if facilities charges internal fees to departments, he may control significant "off-budget" revenue
- Check: Are there auxiliary funds, reserves, or enterprise accounts under his control?

**2. Legal Shields:** Moderate
- University employment may provide tenure-like protections
- Long-term vendor contracts he negotiated create obligations
- Deferred maintenance documentation only he fully understands

**3. Expertise Monopoly:** Strong
- 25 years of institutional knowledge
- Relationships with contractors, regulators, unions
- Knowledge of where the problems are buried
- Understanding of complex building systems

**4. Constituency Dependencies:** Strong
- Contractors depend on his contracts
- Staff depend on his goodwill for jobs
- Deans depend on him for building projects
- He probably controls summer jobs for trustees' children

**5. Structural Longevity:** Very Strong
- Buildings outlast presidents
- Deferred maintenance is a 30-year problem
- His knowledge is irreplaceable
- No succession planning (likely intentional)

**Why no one removes him:**
- Presidents serve 5-7 years; he's seen 4-5 of them
- Removing him means:
  - Losing institutional memory
  - Angering contractor network
  - Inheriting problems only he knows about
  - Finding someone else to blame when buildings fail

**What would end his power:**
- A scandal that forces action (safety failure, financial irregularity)
- External audit that documents his systems
- A president willing to accept chaos during transition
- Mandatory retirement age

He's a classic case of power through indispensability. The solution isn't removal—it's building parallel knowledge and systems that reduce dependency.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **public-authority-design** - Understanding how self-funding entities are created
- **fait-accompli-strategy** - How power is exercised once accumulated
- **infrastructure-as-power** - How physical assets encode power relationships

---

## Ethical Note

This skill is for **understanding power**, not accumulating it without accountability. Moses's methods caused immense harm. Analyzing power structures helps citizens, journalists, and reformers understand and check concentrated power.
